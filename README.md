# Library-Management

It is only an assignment of data structure course, can not used for book management in realityÔºÅ

This program is only a simple demo of library management.
In this program, xml files are used to store both book information and reader information.

The userinterface was written in Qt the basic xml operations are also based on Qt.

So far, it is only an incomplete program with a  briefly designed UI and some xml operations that is specificly designed to 
manage the book information. Most of the interfaces are still remain undesigned.
